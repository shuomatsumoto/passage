  白いテーブルの下で、ほとんど何も見えない中、自分の内臓を探していた。I know that there lie creepy organs within me, heard from my mother. Nu nu nu new born, everytime when new is born, I immediately search for my organs. "Wake up," a voice is calling me from out of the table. I respond it for noticed by him, here, I'm here. I'm always here, by you. Bye by by by you. By your side, by your suicide. Restricted by abrupt myself, and different "I" occurs from it. I, every I is different. As I call myself "I", it means more differently, and it sounds less familiously. And I. You and I, I I I I I I.
  Next day, I return to his myself. I cover my skin as he is. I'm him. I sound him. Yes, he's already dead. I, for himself, return to him. And I'm him. I regularly him. I risked myself for being him regularly. I, I lie in the class and hear a different voice within me, of mine. I, I, always return to him. Meet friends as him, I like to meet freinds as him. His dead body, I love his endless life. "Hi," I said to me, "Endless life." I'm grateful to meet myself within me. Only within me. I appear only within me. And I always talk to me, within me, meet meat meet meet me meat me meat me.
  A doctor tells me that "You cannot do anything at all," and I respawn with pale. Reproduced "me", appeared and behave as him in a daily basis, "Hell-o, hell-o." Return to the entrance, and I knock the white door, meeting my white mother. "Hey, I'm waiting for you," and smiled himself, "You look pretty good today." I lie, under the bed, under the white bed always. And say to myself repeatedly, I, I, I, I, I, I, I. I do, I don't, I a and another I. I, I, I, I.
